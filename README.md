# Country App

## Currently fixing this app since the release of v3 of the API broke functionality.

---

Application bootstrapped with create-react-app, fetching data from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/). The goal of this project was to learn state management tools (React Redux, Context API) using TypeScript.

Users can add items to the cart, which get stored in localStorage, remove them and view details on a separate page.
